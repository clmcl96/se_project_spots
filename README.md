# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

### Project submission number 1

Just put the finishing touches on the project and it is ready to be submitted. I got stuck on a couple of issues that didn't allow the webpage to look quite right when I scaled them down to mobile view but was able to figure out the issue going on there. I now know how important it is not to get width and max-width confused. Next, I'll be deploying the finished project to github pages and then I'll be recording the video and pasting the link below.
